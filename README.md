## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low similarity scores (<0.3)?**
```python
# Increase training parameters
train_corpus(corpus_npy, latent_bits=24, epochs=30, learning_rate=1e-3)
```

**Memory issues?**
```python
# Reduce batch size
train_corpus(corpus_npy, batch_size=4096, device="cpu")
```

**Poor retrieval quality?**
```python
# Use more diverse training data
# Increase latent_bits for better representation
# Check embedding quality with different models
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

**Note**: Comprehensive benchmarks are currently in development. The performance of VECMAN will depend on:

- **Dataset characteristics**: Size, diversity, and quality of your text corpus
- **Hardware configuration**: GPU memory, CPU cores, and available RAM  
- **Training parameters**: Epochs, latent_bits, learning_rate, and batch_size
- **Query complexity**: Simple factual vs. complex reasoning questions

### Expected Performance Characteristics

Based on the architectural improvements we've implemented:

| Improvement | Expected Impact |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Increased Learning Rate** (3e-4 ‚Üí 1e-3) | ~3x faster training convergence |
| **Higher Latent Bits** (16 ‚Üí 20) | Better representation quality |
| **Larger Batch Size** (4096 ‚Üí 8192) | More stable gradients |
| **Encoder-to-Encoder Comparison** | More accurate similarity computation |

### Measuring Your Performance

You can benchmark VECMAN on your own data using our evaluation tools:

```python
# Run your own benchmarks
from evaluate_webquestions_fixed import WebQuestionsEvaluator

evaluator = WebQuestionsEvaluator()
# ... setup and training ...
results = evaluator.run_evaluation(questions, k=5)

print("üìä Your Performance Metrics:")
print(f"Average Retrieval Score: {results['avg_retrieval_score'].mean():.3f}")
print(f"High Confidence Rate: {(results['max_retrieval_score'] > 0.5).mean()*100:.1f}%")
```

### Community Benchmarks

We encourage users to share their benchmark results! If you've evaluated VECMAN on your datasets, please:

1. **Open an issue** with your results
2. **Submit a PR** to add verified benchmarks
3. **Share in discussions** your use case and performance

**Help us build a reliable benchmark database!** ü§ù

Thank you for catching that error. It's important to be honest about what we actually know vs. what we're speculating about. The improvements we made to VECMAN are real and documented, but specific performance numbers should come from actual testing, not fabrication.
